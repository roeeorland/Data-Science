| As the title suggests, this will be a short lesson introducing you to graphics devices in R.
| So, what IS a graphics device?

...

|=====                                                                                |   6%

| Would you believe that it is something where you can make a plot appear, either a screen
| device, such as a window on your computer, OR a file device?

...

|=======                                                                              |   9%

| There are several different kinds of file devices with particular characteristics and hence
| uses. These include PDF, PNG, JPEG, SVG, and TIFF. We'll talk more about these later.

...

|==========                                                                           |  12%

| To be clear, when you make a plot in R, it has to be "sent" to a specific graphics device.
| Usually this is the screen (the default device), especially when you're doing exploratory
| work. You'll send your plots to files when you're ready to publish a report, make a
| presentation, or send info to colleagues.

...

| How you access your screen device depends on what computer system you're using. On a Mac the
| screen device is launched with the call quartz(), on Windows you use the call windows(), and
| on Unix/Linux x11().  On a given platform (Mac, Windows, Unix/Linux) there is only one
| screen device, and obviously not all graphics devices are available on all platforms (i.e.
| you cannot launch windows() on a Mac).

| Run the R command ?Devices to see what graphics devices are available on your system.

| There are two basic approaches to plotting. The first, plotting to the screen, is the most
| common. It's simple - you call a plotting function like plot, xyplot, or qplot (which you
