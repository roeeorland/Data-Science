| R has a special way of representing dates and times, which can be helpful if you're working with data that show how something changes over time (i.e. time-series
| data) or if your data contain some other temporal information, like dates of birth.

| Dates are represented by the 'Date' class and times are represented by the 'POSIXct' and 'POSIXlt' classes. Internally, dates are stored as the number of days since
| 1970-01-01 and times are stored as either the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 (for 'POSIXct') or a list of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. (for 'POSIXlt').

| As you may have anticipated, you get a negative number. In this case, it's -365, since 1969-01-01 is exactly one calendar year (i.e. 365 days) BEFORE 1970-01-01.

| Now that we have explored all three types of date and time objects, let's look at a few functions that extract useful information from any of these objects --
| weekdays(), months(), and quarters().

| The weekdays() function will return the day of week from any date or time object. Try it out on d1, which is the Date object that contains today's date.

> weekdays(d1)

| The months() function also works on any date or time object. Try it on t1, which is the POSIXct object that contains the current time (well, it was the current time

| The quarters() function returns the quarter of the year (Q1-Q4) from any date or time object. Try it on t2, which is the POSIXlt object that contains the time at
| which you created it.

| Often, the dates and times in a dataset will be in a format that R does not recognize. The strptime() function can be helpful in this situation.

...

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |=============================================================================================================                                                |  69%
| strptime() converts character vectors to POSIXlt. In that sense, it is similar to as.POSIXlt(), except that the input doesn't have to be in a particular format
| (YYYY-MM-DD).

...

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |=================================================================================================================                                            |  72%
| To see how it works, store the following character string in a variable called t3: "October 17, 1986 08:24" (with the quotes).

> t3<-"October 17, 1986 08:24"

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |======================================================================================================================                                       |  75%
| Now, use strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M") to help R convert our date/time object to a format that it understands. Assign the result to a new variable called t4. (You
| should pull up the documentation for strptime() if you'd like to know more about how it works.)

> t4<-strptime(t3,"%B %d %Y %H:%M")

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| t4 <- strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M") will convert our date/time object to a format that R understands.

| That's the format we've come to expect. Now, let's check its class().

| Finally, there are a number of operations that you can perform on dates and times, including arithmetic operations (+ and -) and comparisons (<, ==, etc.)

...

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |=======================================================================================================================================                      |  86%
| The variable t1 contains the time at which you created it (recall you used Sys.time()). Confirm that some time has passed since you created t1 by using the 'greater
| than' operator to compare it to the current time: Sys.time() > t1

> t1<Sys.time()
[1] TRUE

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Sys.time() > t1 will tell you that the current time is after the time contained in t1 (which was the current time when you created it).

> Sys.time()>t1
[1] TRUE

| Great job!

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |============================================================================================================================================                 |  89%
| So we know that some time has passed, but how much? Try subtracting t1 from the current time using Sys.time() - t1. Don't forget the parentheses at the end of
| Sys.time(), since it is a function.

> Sys.time()-t1
Time difference of 12.12787 hours

| The same line of thinking applies to addition and the other comparison operators. If you want more control over the units when finding the above difference in
| times, you can use difftime(), which allows you to specify a 'units' parameter.

...

  |                                                                                                                                                                     |====================================================================================================================================================         |  94%
| Use difftime(Sys.time(), t1, units = 'days') to find the amount of time in DAYS that has passed since you created t1.

> difftime(Sys.time(),t1,units='days')
Time difference of 0.5059624 days
